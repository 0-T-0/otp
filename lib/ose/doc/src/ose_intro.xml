    <title>run_erl and to_erl</title>
    <p>
      In OSE run_erl and to_erl are combined into a single load module called
      run_erl_lm. Installing and starting the load module will add two new
      shell commands called run_erl and to_erl. They work in exactly the same
      way as the unix variants of run_erl and to_erl, except that the read
      and write pipes have to be placed under the /pipe vm. One additional
      option also exists to run_erl on ose:
      <taglist>
	<tag><c>-block Name</c></tag>
	<item>The name of the install handle and block that will be created/used by
	installing and exectuting the first part of the command. If nothing
	if given the basename of the load module will be used for this value.
	Example:
	<code>pm_install erlang /path/to/erlang/vm
run_erl -daemon -block erlang /pipe/ /mst/erlang_logs/ "erl -A 10"</code>
	</item>
      </taglist>
