HOWTO for building books for printing
-------------------------------------

Note:	Books are also built automatically by a daily build script.
	That is the only safe way to build books. 

Note:	Manual handling of dependency files has been removed. 

1.	To build a book, ug say, in pdf format with a frame, be sure
	to have a clean view, and run

	i)	clearmake -V clean
	ii)	clearmake -V depend
	iii)	clearmake -V ug.frame.pdf

	You can build the following variants: ug.ps, ug.pdf, ug.frame.ps,
	ug.frame.pdf, ug.crop.ps, and ug.crop.pdf. 

	To build all frame.pdf and crop.pdf books replace iii) by

	iii)	clearmake -V release_books TESTROOT=/some/dest/dir

	and you will get all books in /some/dest/dir.

2.	To change the contents of a book you have to:

	i)	Edit the sgml book file, e.g. ug.sgml.

	ii)	Do the corresponding changes in the Makefile (if needed).
