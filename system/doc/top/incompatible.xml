	    <p>If a module contains an exported function with the

	    <p>(The reason for the change is to avoid breaking code
	    in a future major release, R14 or R15, in which we plan
	    to make calls without a module prefix always call the
	    local function in the same module even if there is an
	    auto-imported BIF with the same name.)</p>

	    <p>Support for Unicode is implemented as described in
	    EEP10. Formatting and reading of unicode data both from
	    terminals and files is supported by the io and io_lib
	    modules. Files can be opened in modes with automatic
	    translation to and from different unicode formats. The
	    module 'unicode' contains functions for conversion
	    between external and internal unicode formats and the re
	    module has support for unicode data. There is also
	    language syntax for specifying string and character data
	    beyond the ISO-latin-1 range.</p>
	    <p>The interactive shell will support input and output of
	    unicode characters when the terminal and operating system
	    supports it.</p>
	    <p>Please see the EEP and the io/io_lib manual pages as
	    well as the stdlib users guide for details.</p>
	    <p><em>I/O-protocol incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>The io_protocol between io_Server and client is
	    updated to handle protocol data in unicode formats. The
	    updated protocol is now documented. The specification
	    resides in the stdlib <em>users manual</em>, which is a
	    new part of the manual.</p>
	    <p><em>io module incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>The io:put_chars, io:get_chars and io:get_line all
	    handle and return unicode data. In the case where
	    binaries can be provided (as to io:put_chars), they shall
	    be encoded in UTF-8. When binaries are returned (as by
	    io:get_line/get_chars when the io_server is set in
	    <em>binary mode</em>) the returned data is also
	    <em>always</em> encoded as UTF-8. The file module however
	    still returns byte-oriented data, why file:read can be
	    used instead of io:get_chars to read binary data in
	    ISO-latin-1.</p>
	    <p><em>io_lib module incompatibilities:</em></p>
	    <p>io_lib:format can, given new format directives (i.e
	    "~ts" and "~tc"), return lists containing integers larger
	    than 255. </p>

	    <p>The escape sequences <c>\x</c> and <c>\{</c> have been
	    assigned new interpretations (they used to return the
	    ASCII code for <c>x</c> and <c>{</c> respectively). One
	    or more octal characters inside curly brackets after a
	    leading backslash is from now on an alternative to the
	    existing syntax <c>\NNN</c>, but can also be used for
	    codes greater than 255. In a similar fashion, one or more
	    hexadecimal characters can be put inside curly brackets
	    after a leading <c>\x</c>. Furthermore, the escape
	    sequences <c>\xH</c> and <c>\xHH</c>, where N is a
	    hexadecimal character, can be used for codes less than
	    256.</p>
	    <p>NOTE: These new escape sequences are still considered
	    experimental and may be changed in the R13B release.</p>

	    A number of fixes and improvements from the ErlIDE group;
	    Vlad Dumitrescu and Jakob Cederlund: JDK 1.5 is now a
	    minimal requirement for building Jinterface. New method:
	    OtpEpmd.lookupNames. OtpErlangList is now iterable.
	    Non-proper lists are now allowed - you have to test if a
	    list is proper or not. Non-proper lists can also be
	    created. New methods: isProper, getHead, getTail and
	    getNthTail. The get tail methods creates a sublist object
	    that re-uses the original list. OtpErlangPid is now
	    Comparable. Empty atoms can now be constructed, a missing
	    feature pointed out by Sebastien Boisgerault on
	    erlang-questions.</p>

	    <c>filelib:fold_files/5</c> now uses the <c>re</c> module

	    is treated as literal characters by <c>regexp</c> but as
