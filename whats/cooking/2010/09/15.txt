------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* er/ei-decode_msg (erl_interface) (2010-03-11) 1 commit
 - Add function to decode distribution header (864091a)

Needs documentation and test cases.

Action expected from: Topic author

* jn/gen_stream (stdlib) (2010-09-05) 5 commits
 - Use erlang:process_info(Pid, links) to determine if gen_stream managed worker processes are leaked (b2386df)
 - Move gen_stream internal process test to after termination of gen_stream parent (f1d8a97)
 - Add calls to code loader in every test to verify code loader still running (ac6cbba)
 - Track gen_stream processes directly for accurate test results (38a4083)
 - Patch dev to reproduce jn/gen_stream (7694a74)

 . Add new gen_stream behaviour for efficiently consuming serial streams (65f3db8)

This topic branch has a failing test case:

shell_SUITE:start_restricted_from_shell;
    We have now tested with and without this topic branch and when
    it is present that test case fails. We consider it proved
    to be guilty. The test case does not fail when run standalone
    so it seems to be tricky... Also, some of its own test cases
    fail sporadicly.

Action expected from: Topic author.

* jp/dependencies_makefile (compiler, erts) (2010-02-14) 3 commits
 - squash! eliminate dialyzer warning (434e2ca)
 - squash! fix snprintf for Windows (bf2708d)
 - Add dependencies Makefile generation to erlc(1) and compile(3) (7cbc437)

Approved in principle by the OTP Technical Board; now awaits a closer
review of the implementation.

Action expected from: Bj√∂rn Gustavsson (the reviewer)

* kr/gs-browser (gs) (2010-02-10) 1 commit
 - Change lib/gs/src/tool_utils.erl to select multiple browsers other than Netscape (802d159)

This topic branch introduces a new call to the deprecated regexp module.

Action expected from: Topic author or anyone else with an interest to
advance the topic

* sf/erts_de_busy_limit (erts) (2010-06-08) 1 commit
 - Add flag-based setting for 'erts_de_busy_limit' constant (67ed9ab)

This topic branch has multiple issues described in this email:

http://www.erlang.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:1303:201008:ldciadjdmjednikemjch

Action expected from: Topic author.

* uw/epmd-fullnames (kernel) (2010-05-07) 1 commit
 . Allow the erlang nodename host part to differ from the hostname (e0774be)

This topic branch needs to be rebased and the conflicts resolved.

This topic branch also needs documentation and test cases.

We are likely to approve the branch for graduation if those issues
are fixed.

Action expected from: Topic author.
