There are no graduations this time, but we expect there
will be a few next week.

We have just got automatic builds and tests based on the
'pu' branch running. That means that in the future,
we can give quicker feedback on branches that does not
build on all platforms.

This time, three branches have been dropped because of
problems found by the automatic tests.

We will cook this topic for a while and include it in the next

 - Add -D_XOPEN_SOURCE to CPPFLAGS on Darwin platforms (6e60658)
 - Test for reliable fpes on Darwin platforms without DARWIN_MODERN_MCONTEXT (4160466)

Reliable floating point exceptions is necessary for hipe to
be enabled. I can confirm that hipe can now be enabled on
Snow Leopard (10.6) and that it speeds up building of the
Dialyzer PLT.

This branch depends on functionality that is deprecated
in Mac OS 10.6, so it might be necessary to find another solution
when 10.7 will be released (in case it removes the deprecated
functionality).

We would like to hear about how this patch works on older versions
of Mac OS X. It is known to work on Tiger/PPC.

* uw/shell-tab-completion (stdlib) (2009-12-17) 1 commit

------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped]

* aq/asn1-incomplete-packet (asn1) (2009-12-16) 1 commit
 . asn1: let decode/2 functions handle incomplete packets (5dbde5a)

Breaks the test test suite for the public_key application.

* fh/common_test-includes (common_test) (2009-12-24) 2 commits
 . change the examples' -include to -include_lib with ct.hrl (3a991e2)
 . change -include for -include_lib to avoid compile errors (48420a4)

The system does not build from scratch when this branch is
included because the common_test application is not included
in the bootstrap.

* jb/atom-table-size-env (erts, otp) (2009-12-21) 1 commit
 . Added ERL_ATOM_TABLE_SIZE environment variable (f1bf944)

Does not build on Windows. (MIN and MAX macros are not defined
on Windows.)
