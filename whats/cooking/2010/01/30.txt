We still have a few issues to solve regarding building
of documentation in a git repository. We hope to
sort them out next week.

------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated]

* mp/hipe-smp-fixes (erts, kernel) (2010-01-27) 2 commits
 + work around hipe_mfa_info_table lock omission (24146d3)
 + fix hipe loader SMP non-atomicity error (38cec58)

* ta/ensure_dir_eexist (stdlib) (2010-01-23) 2 commits
 + filelib_SUITE: strenghten tests of filelib:ensure_dir/1 (67657ed)
 + Don't return a false {error,eexist} in filelib:ensure_dir/1 (ecd339d)

------------------------------------------------------------
[New topics]

* bg/skip-native-compilation (compiler, stdlib) (2010-01-29) 2 commits
 - lists_SUITE: Don't native-compile (45ed02b)
 - andor_SUITE: Don't native-compile (67c05d8)

This branch is never supposed to graduate. Its purpose is to
avoid some failed test cases until there is a proper fix.

* dgud/emacs-mode (tools) (2010-01-26) 2 commits
 - Added the old style skeletons, and a variable to change. (2cbe853)
 - Move code skeletons to a separate file. Use the updated skeletons from the Erlware Mode. (b4fd161)

* jb/atom-table-size (erts) (2010-01-29) 1 commit
 - Add the +t emulator option to change the maximum number of atoms (704b917)

(Replacement for the jb/atom_table_size_env branch.) This branch will probably
be graduated next week after a final review of the implementation.

* jn/sasl-format_report (sasl) (2010-01-27) 1 commit
 - Added sasl_report:format_report/3 to return a string rather than send an io (ee8f29f)

------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sc/sctp-connect-nowait (kernel) (2009-12-21) 1 commit
 - Implement a non-blocking SCTP connect (ae3d819)

Approved in principle, but the implementation needs some
finish touches as pointed out by Raimo, and also
documentation and test cases.

------------------------------------------------------------

Extend the pre-processor to allow overloading of macros with
the same name but different arities.

before the R13B04 release.
