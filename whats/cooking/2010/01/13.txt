Subject: What's cooking in erlang/otp (2010-01-13)
X-dev-at: 009152080c9009498026db17ccee244171423c1c

Several people have asked me about the unusual workflow,
in particular why the topic branches are not directly available
but only available as part of 'pu' branch.

The main reason is that most people are only interested in a few
topic branches (usually only their own) and not all other branches.
Therefore I don't want to litter the repositories for everyone
with all the topic branches. Also note that remote branches are
not automatically deleted even if they are deleted in the
repository they were fetched from, so all branches that have
been dropped or graduated would still be there in other repositories
even after they have been deleted in the erlang/otp repository.

To make it easier to set up a local branch to continue working
on a branch that has been included in 'pu', I have tried to make
the instructions clearer and also provided a script on the
wiki page:

------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped]

* fh/common_test-includes (common_test) (2009-12-24) 2 commits
 . change the examples' -include to -include_lib with ct.hrl (3a991e2)
 . change -include for -include_lib to avoid compile errors (48420a4)

The system does not build from scratch when this branch is
included because the common_test application is not included
in the bootstrap.

Since this feature has been requested many times in the past,
we plan to fix the build problem (by including test_server.hrl
in the bootstrap) and re-instate this branch.

* jp/gcc-detection-in-makefiles (erts) (2009-12-16) 1 commit
 . Fix GCC detection in ERTS configure script and Makefiles (84e0caf)

This branches clashes with other work being done to better support
cross compilation. We will include the functionality in this branch
in R13B04, but in a slightly different way.
