X-dev-at: 3cfec17ff7aff97c5ec862a8b9e97d245849f9c3

The next release will be R14B01, expected to be released
in December.

The next time I'll send out this email (probably next
week), I intend to drop some branches that have been stalled
for a long time.

 - Add function to decode distribution header (864091a)

Action expected from: Topic author

* jb/erl_call-get_hostent (erl_interface) (2010-09-23) 1 commit
 . Teach erl_call to use an IP address for remote node name (d369555)

Does not build on Windows.

Action expected from: Topic author or anyone else with an interest to
advance the topic

* jn/gen_stream (stdlib) (2010-09-05) 5 commits
 - Use erlang:process_info(Pid, links) to determine if gen_stream managed worker processes are leaked (b2386df)

 . Add new gen_stream behaviour for efficiently consuming serial streams (65f3db8)

This topic branch has a failing test case:

shell_SUITE:start_restricted_from_shell;
    We have now tested with and without this topic branch and when
    it is present that test case fails. We consider it proved
    to be guilty. The test case does not fail when run standalone
    so it seems to be tricky... Also, some of its own test cases
    fail sporadicly.

Action expected from: Topic author.

Action expected from: Topic author or anyone else with an interest to
advance the topic
