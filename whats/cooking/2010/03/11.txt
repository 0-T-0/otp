[Stalled]

* am/spawn_rpc (kernel) (2010-03-07) 2 commits
 . Add filter to remote spawn (d84c5bb)
 . Add filter to rpc (4a621c0)

Awaits a decision by the OTP Technical Board.

* at/odbc_osx_fix (odbc) (2009-11-30) 1 commit
 - Workaround broken ODBC implementation on OSX 10.5 (88c71c9)

The patch in itself is good. It solves the problem on Mac OS X
in the only way that seems possible. Unfortunately, our
test cases fail on Linux, and fixing it seems to require a
backward-incompatible change to the API of the odbc module or
ugly workarounds. The reviewer (Jakob Cederlund) will email
the details and suggest and/or implement a solution.

Action expected from: OTP/Jakob Cederlund

* bg/safer-local_to_univ (erts) (2010-02-11) 1 commit
 - erl_time_sup.c: test for error return from mktime() (0f62f0b)

We will not include this branch in R13B04 for two reasons:

  o We are not 100% sure that this change is harmless on all
    platforms in all timezones.
  o We have an idea how the underlying problem can be fixed in
    the calendar module (only) and I plan to try it out after the
    release. We will keep this branch in pu as a reminder.

Action expected from: Björn Gustavsson

* db/tv_nthtail_fix (tv) (2009-12-01) 1 commit
 - Fix for tv which restarts while trying to open a table (abe0759)

Since our long-term goal is to migrate from gs towards wx,
maintaining the old gs applications has a low priority for
the Erlang/OTP team. Therefore, we will accept patches that
seem sound, but we are unlikely to spend much of our own time
fixing bugs.

The author of this topic branch has found the real reason for
the problem, but uncovered additional issues.

Action expected from: The topic author - to decide whether to
include the topic branch (which is a workaround, but does eliminate
the crash) or to wait for a better fix from himself or someone else
with an interest to advance the topic.

* jp/dependencies_makefile (compiler, erts) (2010-02-14) 3 commits
 - squash! eliminate dialyzer warning (434e2ca)
 - squash! fix snprintf for Windows (bf2708d)
 - Add dependencies Makefile generation to erlc(1) and compile(3) (7cbc437)

Approved in principle by the OTP Technical Board; now awaits a closer
review of the implementation.

Action expected from: Björn Gustavsson (the reviewer)

* jv/update-rpccall-to-use-try (kernel) (2010-02-24) 1 commit
 . fix rpc handling of uncaught throws (3f21ed7)

The follow test cases fall when this topic branch is included:

compiler:  inline_SUITE:barnes2/1
kernel:    global_SUITE:simple_resolve/1
           global_SUITE:simple_resolve2/1
           rpc_SUITE:called_throws/1

Action expected from: Topic author or anyone else with an interest to
advance the topic

* kr/gs-browser (gs) (2010-02-10) 1 commit
 - Change lib/gs/src/tool_utils.erl to select multiple browsers other than Netscape (802d159)

This topic branch introduces a new call to the deprecated regexp module.

Action expected from: Topic author or anyone else with an interest to
advance the topic
