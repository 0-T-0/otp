Subject: What's cooking in erlang/otp (2010-02-02)
X-dev-at: 153e2047d734297df3c55b6fa8bda83fb33c72bd

Provided you have the latest development branch
(ccase/r13b04) it should now be possible to build the
documentation. (Topic branches based on earlier revisions
of the development branch need to be rebased.)

The description for building the documentation can
be found here:

  http://wiki.github.com/erlang/otp/documentation

R13B04 will be released at the end of February. There
will be a feature freeze for the erts, kernel, stdlib,
and compiler applications on February 10. After that,
only bug fixes will be included in those applications.

[New topics]

* bg/erl_bif_types (hipe) (2010-01-31) 1 commit
 - erl_bif_types: add 'http_bin' as a valid packet option (7c72a77)

* bg/temp-hipe-fixes (compiler, hipe, kernel) (2010-01-31) 4 commits
 - Crudely fix return type for the lists:key{search,find,member}/3 (5c9a017)
 - seq_trace_SUITE: Don't native-compile (c569f85)
 - Disable native code if on_load is used (101dcc8)
 - andor_SUITE: Don't native-compile (cb44959)

This branch contains temporary workarounds to avoid failing test
cases and is never intended to graduate.

* dgud/wx_list_ctrl (wx) (2010-02-02) 5 commits
 - Generate without trailing spaces (cfd2ba4)
 - Fix correct starting copyright year (5b585a4)
 - Do not emit trailing whitespace (ce3cd31)

 - Added wxListCtrl:getEditCtrl (not available on Mac) (e6433fc)

* egil/lcnt (erts, tools) (2010-02-01) 6 commits
 - Add test suite for lcnt in tools (e26bedd)
 - Add lcnt:rt_opt/1 bindings to erts_debug (c24d153)
 - Add runtime option to enable/disable lcnt stats (dd665ed)
 - Add auto width on string output (12990af)
 - Add lcnt documentation (41d4913)

------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* sc/sctp-connect-nowait (kernel) (2009-12-21) 1 commit
 - Implement a non-blocking SCTP connect (ae3d819)

Approved in principle, but the implementation needs some
finish touches as pointed out by Raimo, and also
documentation and test cases.

* jn/supervisor_child_count_only (stdlib) (2010-01-25) 1 commit
 - Add count_children/1 to supervisor.erl to determine the number of children being managed without the memory impact of which_children/1 (10ef53f)

Test cases fail when the emulator has been started with the +Meamin
option.

* va/rb-improvements (sasl) (2009-12-25) 4 commits
 - New function to filter reports by date (5391383)
 - New rb:filter/1 function to ease report filtering (ed28348)
 - Add rb:re/1 to grep reports using the re module (e5bd091)
 - Fix minor typo in read_report/1 (07c6ad4)

There is no need to introduce a new function rb:re/1, but
rb:grep/1 can be modified to use the 're' module. Also,
it should not be necessary to compile the regular expression
beforehand.
