Subject: What's cooking in erlang/otp (2010-06-04)
X-dev-at: fa66eb731b85726970cc4c581d32ebdc2ebb965e

R14A is planned to be released on June 16. We will not
include new features for that release. Bug fixes may
be accepted depending on how necessary and risk free
they are.

We may still graduate a few of the cooking branches
to the release...

 - Add Emacs EUnit feature: run recent (7b5a6f1)
 - Add Emacs EUnit feature: auto-save (041ea7c)
 - erlang-eunit: Optionally run code coverage analysis during eunit tests (50a54b8)
 - erlang-eunit: Made alternative locations of files more flexible (c5067db)

* ia/ssl_many_handshake_packages_at_once (ssl) (2010-06-02) 1 commit
 - Fixed handling of several ssl/tls packets arriving at the same time. This was broken during a refactoring of the code. (b279fe0)

* kj/emacs-eunit-run-current-test-with-cover (tools) (2010-05-26) 2 commits
 - erlang-eunit: Optionally run code coverage analysis during eunit tests (50a54b8)
 - erlang-eunit: Made alternative locations of files more flexible (c5067db)

* ks/ets-tid-type (debugger, stdlib) (2010-05-28) 1 commit
 - Remove tid() from the predefined builtin types. (94be2be)

* sv/serge-new_float_ext (erl_interface, odbc) (2010-06-03) 3 commits

------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* bg/safer-local_to_univ (erts) (2010-02-11) 1 commit
 - erl_time_sup.c: test for error return from mktime() (0f62f0b)

We will not include this branch in R13B04 for two reasons:

  o We are not 100% sure that this change is harmless on all
    platforms in all timezones.
  o We have an idea how the underlying problem can be fixed in
    the calendar module (only) and I plan to try it out after the
    release. We will keep this branch in pu as a reminder.

Action expected from: Björn Gustavsson

* db/tv_nthtail_fix (tv) (2009-12-01) 1 commit
 - Fix for tv which restarts while trying to open a table (abe0759)

Since our long-term goal is to migrate from gs towards wx,
maintaining the old gs applications has a low priority for
the Erlang/OTP team. Therefore, we will accept patches that
seem sound, but we are unlikely to spend much of our own time
fixing bugs.

The author of this topic branch has found the real reason for
the problem, but uncovered additional issues.

Action expected from: The topic author - to decide whether to
include the topic branch (which is a workaround, but does eliminate
the crash) or to wait for a better fix from himself or someone else
with an interest to advance the topic.

* er/ei-decode_msg (erl_interface) (2010-03-11) 1 commit
 - Add function to decode distribution header (864091a)

Needs documentation and test cases.

Action expected from: Topic author

* gl/jinterface-pom (jinterface, otp) (2010-02-15) 2 commits
 - Exclude jinterface build artifact from git (5acf5fa)
 - Add pom.xml for jinterface build (aa68190)

The pom.xml file should be generated by the toplevel Makefile
since it contains the version number of Jinterface. This is
along the same line as the .app files are generated.
There should be a pom.xml.src that Makefile sed's into
pom.xml. See stdlib/src/Makefile.

Action expected from: Topic author

* jn/gen_stream (stdlib) (2010-05-17) 1 commit
 - Add new gen_stream behaviour for efficiently consuming serial streams (65f3db8)

This topic branch has failing test cases. 

shell_SUITE:start_restricted_from_shell;
    Although the whole pu branch could be guilty
    this topic branch is our prime suspect. The
    test case does not fail when run standalone
    so this has to be invesigated further.

Action expected from: OTP team

* jp/dependencies_makefile (compiler, erts) (2010-02-14) 3 commits
 - squash! eliminate dialyzer warning (434e2ca)
 - squash! fix snprintf for Windows (bf2708d)
 - Add dependencies Makefile generation to erlc(1) and compile(3) (7cbc437)

Approved in principle by the OTP Technical Board; now awaits a closer
review of the implementation.

Action expected from: Björn Gustavsson (the reviewer)

* kr/gs-browser (gs) (2010-02-10) 1 commit
 - Change lib/gs/src/tool_utils.erl to select multiple browsers other than Netscape (802d159)

This topic branch introduces a new call to the deprecated regexp module.

Action expected from: Topic author or anyone else with an interest to
advance the topic
