Subject: What's cooking in erlang/otp (2010-12-03)
X-dev-at: 74ec1253e1a89f0bb266831f73716a24c0798dc1

The next release will be R14B01, expected to be released
December 8.

Feature branches sent in from now on are unlikely to be
included in R14B01. Bug fixes may still make it, depending
on the application, the severity of the bug, and how unlikely
the bug fix is to break something.

We will try to review and include into the R14B01 release
some more of the branches currently in 'pu'.

------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated]

* bw/gitignore (otp) (2010-10-05) 1 commit
 + Add win32 specific build artifacts to .gitignore (834cd98)

* bw/win32-file-linking (erts) (2010-10-04) 1 commit
 + Add Win32 support for hard and symbolic file system links (1f6d7c8)

* bw/win32-laa (erts) (2010-10-06) 1 commit
 + Added win32 large address aware link option (8bb6f48)

* dc/update-INSTALL-WIN32.md (otp) (2010-09-19) 1 commit
 + Doc update to latest dependencies & how to compile with free VS2008 Express (8e8061c)

------------------------------------------------------------
[New topics]

* dk/agent-capabilities (snmp) (2010-12-01) 1 commit
 - AGENT-CAPABILITIES handling added to SNMP mib compiler (17c3b19)

* fm/posix-fallocate (erts, kernel) (2010-12-01) 1 commit
 - Added file:allocate/3. This function allocates space for a file. It only has effect in POSIX platforms that implement the posix_fallocate system call. (ea3dfb9)

* ms/epmd-local-access-check (erts) (2010-11-24) 1 commit
 - epmd: include host address in local access check (5b68030)

------------------------------------------------------------
[Stalled]

* jn/gen_stream (stdlib) (2010-09-05) 5 commits
 - Use erlang:process_info(Pid, links) to determine if gen_stream managed worker processes are leaked (b2386df)
 - Move gen_stream internal process test to after termination of gen_stream parent (f1d8a97)
 - Add calls to code loader in every test to verify code loader still running (ac6cbba)
 - Track gen_stream processes directly for accurate test results (38a4083)
 - Patch dev to reproduce jn/gen_stream (7694a74)

 . Add new gen_stream behaviour for efficiently consuming serial streams (65f3db8)

This topic branch has a failing test case:

shell_SUITE:start_restricted_from_shell;
    We have now tested with and without this topic branch and when
    it is present that test case fails. We consider it proved
    to be guilty. The test case does not fail when run standalone
    so it seems to be tricky... Also, some of its own test cases
    fail sporadicly.

Action expected from: Topic author.

* jp/dependencies_makefile (compiler, erts) (2009-12-14) 1 commit
 - Add dependencies Makefile generation to erlc(1) and compile(3) (4945add)

Approved in principle by the OTP Technical Board; now awaits a closer
review of the implementation.

Action expected from: Bj√∂rn Gustavsson (the reviewer)

cases and is never intended to graduate.
