This is the first in a series of emails that will be sent
approximately twice a week to erlang-patches@erlang.org.

This first email is also sent to erlang-questions. If you
don't already subscribe to erlang-patches, and want to
be informed about what new features and bug fixes that
may make it into the next release, or to take part in the
discussion, make sure that you subscribe to erlang-patches.

Below you'll find a list of the proposed updates that
have currently been merged to the 'pu' branch in the
erlang/otp repository at github.

To avoid having patches falling to the floor, as have
unfortunately frequently happened in the past, we will now
either merge proposed updates that are not
obviously wrong or inappropriate to the 'pu' branch, or
we will tell you what the problem is. Typically, one of
those things should happen within a workday.

There some is information about patch submitting on the
wiki pages for erlang/otp at github
(http://wiki.github.com/erlang/otp) and we will continue
to update and improve that information.

Here is the list:

* ks/dialyzer-wx-fix (2009-11-28) 1 commit:
- dialyzer: make -wx always start the SMP emulator

Will soon be graduated to ccase/r13b04.

* sv/sys_get_status (2009-11-27) 1 commit:
- This change restores the ability for gen_server and gen_fsm callback
modules to format their own state for display under the
sys:get_status/0 call. This ability is extremely useful for new
behavior modules based on gen_server or gen_fsm, so that they can
display their status in a more meaningful way than just dumping the
state record. It is also generally useful for applications wanting to
display their gen_server or gen_fsm callback module state in something
other than the default manner.

Steve is working on documentation and test cases.

* bg/on_load-types (2009-11-27) 1 commit:

Confirmed by Kostis that it is OK, so it will soon be graduated to
