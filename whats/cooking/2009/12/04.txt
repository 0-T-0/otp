Thanks, noss, for filling the placeholder page I
mentioned in the previous email. Now real information
can be found at:

------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated]

 - Optimize egd render speed and reduce code size (8d2bc78)

* mh/to_erl-error-messages (2009-11-27) 1 commit
 - to_erl: Include strerror(errno) in error messages (ace6e42)

------------------------------------------------------------
[New topics]

* at/odbc_osx_fix (2009-11-30) 1 commit
 - Workaround broken ODBC implementation on OSX 10.5 (88c71c9)

* bg/otp_build-improvements (2009-12-02) 3 commits
 - Support updating the primary bootstrap in a git repository (d6a3861)
 - Determine which VCS is being used (c16fcaf)
 - .gitignore: Don't ignore script/boot files in bootstrap/bin (2bcfe0d)

* bg/slimmer-history (2009-12-02) 2 commits
 - beam_makepos: Do not put any dates in generated files (a910f28)
 - compiler: Teach 'slim' to omit compilation info (2c76865)

We don't want the compiler to put the date/time or the compiler's version
numbers into the beam files in the checked-in bootstrap, because
then all beam files in the bootstrap will have to be replaced every
time the primary bootstrap is updated.

The only potential problem this might cause is *if* the primary
bootstrap should need to be native-code compiled (the hipe compiler
checks the version number to make sure that the beam file was
compiled by a supported compiler, I think).

* db/tv_nthtail_fix (2009-12-01) 1 commit
 - Fix for tv which restarts while trying to open a table (bfc18a8)

We will cook this topic for a while and include it in the next
release unless someone finds a problem with it or a better fix.

* dh/doc-fixes (2009-12-01) 1 commit
 - fix for minor documentation xml issues (185bb92)

The problems were in two XML files that are not currently used
and will soon be removed. The third file (in wx) is not a complete
XML, but merely a template. It should have another extension.

We will keep this branch as a reminder until the real problems
has been fixed.

* po/blowfish_ecb_cbc_ofb (2009-12-03) 2 commits
 - Add Blowfish tests (24300da)
 - Add Blowfish ECB, CBC and OFB modes (b120895)

The crypto test suite is now included in ccase/r13b04_dev, so
I have rebased this branch and resolved the conflicts in
Makefile and crypto.spec.

* sc/sctp_connect_enhancement (2009-12-02) 2 commits
 - Implement a non-blocking gen_sctp:connect (92f3cee)
 - Correctly type sctp_assoc_id as signed, not unsigned (2666b68)

Raimo (the maintainer of the sctp code in OTP) is quite busy
with the new erlang.org site (demo.erlang.org), so there might
be a while before he will look at this branch, but it will
definitely happend before the next release.

* sc/ssl_pkix_extensions (2009-12-02) 1 commit
 - Fix crash when decoding commercial certificates (31ccb1d)

Dan G says that the pkix stuff is deprecated, but that doesn't
seem to be documented and the replacement application public_key
is not documented either. We should probably include this
correction anyway.

We will keep this branch until some sort of decision has
been made.

------------------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* as/c_nc-fix (2009-11-29) 1 commit
 - Fix c:nc to use outdir or cwd to find compiled object file (0d4f83c)

I think there should be a test case before we graduate this topic,
so that we'll know that it will continue to work.

* bd/http_chunk_fix (2009-11-27) 1 commit
 - http_chunk data handling/passing improvement. (c2553be)

* po/odbc-update-delete-no-rows (2009-11-26) 1 commit
 - SQL_NO_DATA and SQLSTATE 00000 indicate success for updates/deletes that affect no rows (1a564f8)
