X-dev-at: 5149d9a729255e8d900d70deb688a51ecd3e1cf1

This is the last What's cooking this year.

Since most of the OTP team has left for vacation, there
will probably not be any updates of the git repository
until Jan 7, 2010.

Happy Holidays!

We will cook this topic for a while and include it in the next
release unless someone finds a problem with it or a better fix.

* po/odbc-update-delete-no-rows (odbc) (2009-11-26) 1 commit
 - SQL_NO_DATA and SQLSTATE 00000 indicate success for updates/deletes that affect no rows (1a564f8)

* tc/premodern-fpe (erts) (2009-12-08) 2 commits
 - Add -D_XOPEN_SOURCE to CPPFLAGS on Darwin platforms (6e60658)
 - Test for reliable fpes on Darwin platforms without DARWIN_MODERN_MCONTEXT (4160466)

Reliable floating point exceptions is necessary for hipe to
be enabled. I can confirm that hipe can now be enabled on
Snow Leopard (10.6) and that it speeds up building of the
Dialyzer PLT.

This branch depends on functionality that is deprecated
in Mac OS 10.6, so it might be necessary to find another solution
when 10.7 will be released (in case it removes the deprecated
functionality).

We would like to hear about how this patch works on older versions
of Mac OS X. It is known to work on Tiger/PPC.

* bw/win32-address-space-fix (erts) (2009-12-10) 1 commit
 .  win32 mmap emulation for mseg support + largeaddressaware linking (357167e)

The branch in its current shape cannot be included in OTP because
it includes copyrighted code with an unknown license. It is also
overkill to emulate mmap() (and it could cause other problems in
the future); the easiest and most straightforward solution is to
implement mseg_create()/mseg_destroy() (in erl_mseg.c) using
VirtualAlloc()/VirtualFree().
