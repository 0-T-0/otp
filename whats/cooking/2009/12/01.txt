Subject: What's cooking in erlang/otp (#2)
X-dev-at: 7a75e61f847c0dd7a97e38b433fd15cedbb50860

This is the second in the What's cooking in erlang/otp
series of emails.

Since the last email there have been some substantial
updates to the wiki at http://wiki.github.com/erlang/otp

Thanks to everyone that have helped editing the pages
(and even created new pages)!

I would want to write about how patches can be refined
using "git rebase -i" and other powerful git commands,
but I realize that I will not have time to do that in
the foreseeable future. So instead I created a placeholder
page:

http://wiki.github.com/erlang/otp/refining-patches-using-git

Feel free to go there and do something great!

------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated to ccase/r13b04_dev]

* ng/readme (2009-11-25) 1 commit
 + Clean up formatting issues in the README

I combined the original two commits to one.

* egil/readme-debug-emulator (2009-11-25) 1 commit:
 + README: Add build instructions for a debug-enabled emulator

I amended his commit to correct a few grammos/typos.

* bg/on_load-types (2009-11-27) 1 commit:
 + Add type information for on_load

* ks/dialyzer-wx-fix (2009-11-28) 1 commit:
 + dialyzer: make -wx always start the SMP emulator

* bg/make_stub_module-fix (2009-11-29) 1 commit:
 + Fix glitches when native code modules are used

------------------------------------------------------------
[New topics]

* as/c_nc-fix (2009-11-29) 1 commit:
 - Fix c:nc to use outdir or cwd to find compiled object file

* mh/to_erl-error-messages (2009-11-27) 1 commit:
 - to_erl: Include strerror(errno) in error messages

------------------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* sv/sys_get_status (2009-11-27) 2 commits:
 - Teach sys:get_status/0 to call Mod:format_status/2
 - gen_fsm: Fix format_status/2 to handle Pids

Steve fixed the documentation and found and fixed an
independent bug in gen_fsm that caused a gen_fsm test
case to fail.

Except that it would be nice with a test case that would
verify that Mod:format_status/2 really gets called
(to ensure that the feature doesn't get broken again
in the future), this branch should be ready for
graduation.

* bd/http_chunk_fix (2009-11-27) 1 commit:
 - http_chunk data handling/passing improvement.

* po/odbc-update-delete-no-rows (2009-11-26) 1 commit:
 - SQL_NO_DATA and SQLSTATE 00000 indicate success for updates/deletes that affect no rows

* egil/misc-egd (2009-11-26) 3 commits:
 - re-added egd color specs and removed commented code
 - added test cases for egd_primitives
 - egd speed optimizations and code reduction

Waiting for Bj√∂rn-Egil to squeeze the series down to one or
two commits and revise the commit messages.
