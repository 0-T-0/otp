Subject: What's cooking in erlang/otp (2009-12-17)
X-dev-at: ebaa01050deb2bbc4cf4e1279e3d8ffe220080d9

There might be one more issue of "What's cooking in erlang/otp"
in the beginning of next week. After that, there will
be no more updates of the 'pu' branch until Jan 7, 2010.

------------------------------------------------------------
[Graduated]

* at/windows_build_fixes (erts, otp) (2009-12-15) 2 commits
 + Updated README.win32 for compiling with VS2008 and issues with mc.exe (346b530)
 + Allow mc.sh and rc.sh to work when path to mc/rc.exe has spaces (98751d5)

* sc/darwin_build_rm_dSYMN (erts) (2009-12-14) 1 commit
 + Fix 'make clean' in erts with debug builds under Darwin (2468a47)

* sc/ei_decode_skip_fun (erl_interface) (2009-12-14) 1 commit
 + Fix ei_skip_term() handling of funs encoded as NEW_FUN_EXT (d0db866)

------------------------------------------------------------
[New topics]

* aq/asn1-incomplete-packet (asn1) (2009-12-16) 1 commit
 - Change asn1 : generated decode/2 functions return {error,incomplete}  when argument packet is incomplete. (59d7f7f)

* cf/compile_warning_as_error (compiler, erts) (2009-12-15) 3 commits
 - Add option -Werror in erlc(1) (d29a335)
 - compile: add flag warnings_as_errors to treat warnings as errors (13124f5)
 - compile.erl: remove trailing whitespace (8a944af)

* dgud/dbg_mac_menu (debugger) (2009-12-16) 4 commits
 - Dbg: Expand the module listbox when window grows. (25c200b)
 - Dbg: Cut variable bindings after 80 chars. (a488613)
 - Dbg: Fixed documentation links to the new index.html (776ab02)
 - Dbg Fixed mac gui issues (b7c6db6)

* jp/dependencies_makefile (compiler, erts) (2009-12-14) 1 commit
 - Add dependencies Makefile generation to erlc(1) and compile(3) (c0734e8)

* jp/gcc-detection-in-makefiles (Makefile.in
, asn1, crypto, erts, ic, orber, os_mon, runtime_tools, ssl, tools) (2009-12-16) 2 commits
 - Replace the $(CC_IS_GCC) flag by more generic $(CC_NAME) variable (51be25f)
 - Fix GCC detection in ERTS configure script and Makefiles (34fb108)

This seems to be a worthwhile change, but only Makefiles that
can actually gain anything should be updated. Also there does
not seem to be any reason that there are two commits rather
than just one.

------------------------------------------------------------
[Cooking]

* at/odbc_osx_fix (odbc) (2009-11-30) 1 commit
 - Workaround broken ODBC implementation on OSX 10.5 (88c71c9)

* bd/http_chunk_fix (inets) (2009-11-27) 1 commit
 - http_chunk data handling/passing improvement. (c2553be)

* bg/otp_build-improvements (otp, stdlib) (2009-12-02) 3 commits
 - Support updating the primary bootstrap in a git repository (6840b32)
 - Determine which VCS is being used (5770b7b)
 - stdlib makefile: Add explicit rule (b197d92)

* bw/win32-address-space-fix (erts) (2009-12-10) 1 commit
 -  win32 mmap emulation for mseg support + largeaddressaware linking (357167e)

The branch in its current shape cannot be included in OTP because
it includes copyrighted code with an unknown license. It is also
overkill to emulate mmap() (and it could cause other problems in
the future); the easiest and most straightforward solution is to
implement mseg_create()/mseg_destroy() (in erl_mseg.c) using
VirtualAlloc()/VirtualFree().


* cf/epp-macro-overloading (otp, stdlib) (2009-12-10) 4 commits
 - update the documentation on preprocessor in the reference manual (162ec27)
 - epp: change rules to choose the right version of a macro (8dcc9f8)
 - epp: Add support of macros overloading (f7a8959)
 - epp: fix bug in the function scan_undef (52543e0)

Extend the pre-processor to allow overloading of macros with
the same name but different arities. Now with documentation.


* db/tv_nthtail_fix (tv) (2009-12-01) 1 commit
 - Fix for tv which restarts while trying to open a table (bfc18a8)

We will cook this topic for a while and include it in the next
release unless someone finds a problem with it or a better fix.

* po/odbc-update-delete-no-rows (odbc) (2009-11-26) 1 commit
 - SQL_NO_DATA and SQLSTATE 00000 indicate success for updates/deletes that affect no rows (1a564f8)

* tc/premodern-fpe (erts) (2009-12-08) 2 commits
 - Add -D_XOPEN_SOURCE to CPPFLAGS on Darwin platforms (ea2fae6)
 - Test for reliable fpes on Darwin platforms without DARWIN_MODERN_MCONTEXT (b95cf92)

Reliable floating point exceptions is necessary for hipe to
be enabled. I can confirm that hipe can now be enabled on
Snow Leopard (10.6) and that it speeds up building of the
Dialyzer PLT.

This branch depends on functionality that is deprecated
in Mac OS 10.6, so it might be necessary to find another solution
when 10.7 will be released (in case it removes the deprecated
functionality).

We would like to hear about how this patch works on older versions
of Mac OS X. It is known to work on Tiger/PPC.

------------------------------------------------------------
[Dropped]

* sc/sctp_connect_enhancement (erts, kernel) (2009-12-02) 2 commits
 . Implement a non-blocking gen_sctp:connect (92f3cee)
 . Correctly type sctp_assoc_id as signed, not unsigned (2666b68)

We have solved "Correctly type sctp_assoc_id..." in a different
way (now included in the development branch).

We are waiting for a replacement for "Implement a non-blocking
gen_sctp:connect".

* sc/ssl_pkix_extensions (ssl) (2009-12-02) 1 commit
 . Fix crash when decoding commercial certificates (31ccb1d)

The pkix stuff is in the ssl application is deprecated and has
been replaced with public key application. That functionality
in public_key is also documented.

* vd/eep8_doc (otp) (2009-12-14) 1 commit
 . add reference to EEP8 (36d251b)

Replaced by a revised version now included in the development
branch.
